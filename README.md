# Airline Flight Delays Analysis with Microsoft SQL Server

This is an exhibition of my skills in using Microsoft SQL to interact with a relational database.
The data used in this project was provided by Quantum Analytics NG. It contains records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline
name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as
scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.

Clauses and Concepts applied include:

- SELECT clause
- TOP
- GROUP BY
- ORDER BY
- JOIN
- COUNT (DISTINCT())
- AVG()
- ROUND()
- Subqueries
- ALTER TABLE
- UPDATE

### Problem Statement
- How does the overall flight volume vary by month?
- How does the overall flight volume vary by day of week?
- Percentage of flights that experienced a departure delay in 2015
- Average Departure delay time in minute
- Total Flight Cancellation in 2015
- Cancellation reasons
- Most relaible airlines in terms of on-time departure
- Least relaible airlines in terms of late departure
- Least relaible airlines in terms of Cancellation
