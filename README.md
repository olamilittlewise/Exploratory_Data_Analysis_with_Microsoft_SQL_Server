# Airline Flight Delays with Microsoft SQL Server

This is an exhibition of my skills in using Microsoft SQL to interact with a relational database.
The data used in this project was provided by Quantum Analytics NG. It contains records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline
name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as
scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.

Clauses and Concepts applied include:

- SELECT clause
- TOP
- GROUP BY
- ORDER BY
- JOIN
- COUNT (DISTINCT())
- AVG()
- ROUND()
- Subqueries
- ALTER TABLE
- UPDATE
